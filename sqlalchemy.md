1. **`from sqlalchemy import create_engine`**:
   - This line imports the `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy. This function is used to create a connection to a database.

2. **`from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String`**:
   - These imports bring in the `Column`, `Integer`, and `String` classes from SQLAlchemy. They are used to define columns and their data types for the database tables.

3. **`from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base`**:
   - This imports the `declarative_base` function, which allows us to create a base class for our models (tables). Models inherit from this base class to map to database tables.

4. **`db_url = "sqlite:///students.db"`**:
   - This line sets a variable `db_url` with the database connection URL. It specifies that we are using an SQLite database, and `students.db` is the file that will store the data.

5. **`engine = create_engine(db_url)`**:
   - This creates an engine using the database URL defined earlier. The engine is responsible for managing the connection to the database.

6. **`Base = declarative_base()`**:
   - This creates a base class called `Base`. Any class that we define (representing a table) will inherit from this `Base` class.

7. **`class User(Base):`**:
   - This defines a class `User` that represents a table in the database. Each class attribute will correspond to a column in the database.

8. **`__tablename__ = "users"`**:
   - This specifies the name of the table in the database. The table for this model will be called `users`.

9. **`id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)`**:
   - This defines a column `id` in the `users` table. The column is of type `Integer` and will serve as the primary key (a unique identifier for each row).

10. **`name = Column(String)`**:
    - This defines a column `name` in the `users` table. It will store string values.

11. **`age = Column(Integer)`**:
    - This defines a column `age` in the `users` table. It will store integer values.

12. **`Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`**:
    - This tells SQLAlchemy to create all tables (in this case, the `users` table) in the database by using the models weâ€™ve defined and the engine we created.

In summary, this code sets up a database connection, defines a table (`users`) with three columns (`id`, `name`, `age`), and creates the table in the SQLite database.
